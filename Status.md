# Status of Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G

The development for the Windows Port is currently scheduled as follows:

- ~~Milestone #0: Early UEFI/OS bring up, proof of concept~~ Completed!
- Milestone #1: SoC hardware bringup in Windows OS, end goal is to have all hardware blocks/components of the SoC in a functional or communicating state by the end of the milestone, but not have it interface with the OS if it isn't already done. **In progress!**
- Milestone #2: Bug fixes, this is where we will fix major issues like crashes, etc
- Milestone #3: Calibration/Tuning, calibrate everything to work as it should be.
- Milestone #4: To be defined?

_No ETA will be provided for **any** of these development phases_
